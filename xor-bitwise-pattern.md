## Exclusive-OR Operator (^)
* Exclusive-OR returns a bit value of 1 if both bits are opposite, otherwise Exclusive-OR retuens 0
Remember the properties of XOR operator :
• If you take xor of a number with 0 ( zero ), it would return the same number again.
Means, n^0 = n
• If you take xor of a number with itself, it would return 0 ( zero ).
Means, n^ n = 0
